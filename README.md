Wow your boss or your friends with this beautiful Excel macro.

It takes a boring Excel worksheet and pimps it out. A lot of people use color senselessly when using data, so I wanted to automate that process.

Here are a couple examples so that you can see this macro in action. Here is statistics for the New York Red Bulls. They are so boring. You won't be able to make any convincing arguments using these stats.
